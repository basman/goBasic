	// write a program that finds two square numbers where the sum is a third square number:
	// a*a + b*b = c*c -> find numbers a, b and c fulfilling the equation

	/*
		  Hints:
			- Search through numbers from 1 to 1000 for each placeholder.
			- have the algorithm look for both, a == b != c (a equals b) and a != b != c (a, b and c are all different values)
			- Your algorithm should print all solutions to the terminal, not just the first it may find.
			- Use nested for loops with running counters, one for each placeholder (a, b, c)
			for a := 1; a <= 1000; a++ {
			  for b := 1, ... {
			    for c := 1, ... {
			      ...
			    }
			  }
			}
