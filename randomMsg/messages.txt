+Congratulations, you landed smoothly.
-Bummer! That nice piece of technology smashed right into solid ice and rocks.
-Yo bro, your landing was a no go!
+Dude, you nailed that landing.
+My goodness. Such a wonderful landing. We'd like to hire you for the next one...
-Did you ever consider becoming a gardener? Landing moon rockets doesn't seem to be your thing.
+Bravo! Nicely done.
-May I suggest a different career path? One that does not exceed your skills too much? How about window cleaner on an inoperative museum vessel? 
+Smooth landing, as if done by Armstrong himself while Mr. Collins had to watch from above.
-That was your last landing. Your rocket lays shattered across the Aitkin basin. You may call it art, while mankind calls it a small step.
-My grandma could have done this better. Whatever you call this, it was not a landing.
+Your pa would be proud of ya! Nice landing.
-While Armstrong turns in his grave, you should work on your impact velocity. No dice! 
-Hit the surface just a bit harder and you might make history as the first moon's climate changer.
+Well done!
+Good job!
-Many tried that before. Many have failed, just like you.
-I wonder if they can recover a single part from your rocket. 
-That was rough. I hope there is still a moon to land on until you succeed.
-Being hit smack on by a rocket is business as usual for the moon. For you it's game over.
